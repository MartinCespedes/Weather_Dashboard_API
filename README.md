## :sun_behind_small_cloud:Server Side API Weather

:cloud_with_rain: Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard :cloud_with_rain:

- Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.
- Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own.
- My task is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
